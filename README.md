## ImageX - Drupal Patches

The following is a collection of patches that are used on a regular basis during active development. This repository exists as a central holding area for all patch files that are applied to Drupal Core, contributed modules and themes. The reasoning for this is the result of [ImageX's Installation Kit](http://github.com/imagex/imagex_installkit) and the Drush make process of using a URL for loading patch files.
